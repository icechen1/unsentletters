unsentletters
=============

A little website to display random letters from reddit.com/r/unsentletters

From the subreddit:
> We've all had times where we've wanted to spill the beans to someone, be they bad or good, but never did or can't for whatever reasons. Post a letter here, whether it's a Thank You note or something not so happy.
